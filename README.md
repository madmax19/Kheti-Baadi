An app which provides curated content that can help a farmer at all the stages of the farming process.

#### Problem Statement
There is a lot of information spread on the internet that can help a farmer. Farmers are not tech savvy, barely use smart phones and are unable to consume this information. We want to facilitate farmers to consume information over a simple, multilingual interface and the farmers can get curated information. We want to help them at all the stages of the farming process.
Some of the examples of questions/problems that farmers may have are
mentioned below.
1. Where can I find “Urea”?
2. Which is the best retailer around me?
3. What are the pests danger around me?
4. What is the price of rice in my mandi?
5. Search fertilizer products with parameters such as product name, company name, location proximity.
6. Search dealers with parameters such as dealers selling particular
products/brands, in a particular location, dealers with particular products
in-stock
7. What is my soil health?

Apart from implementing the problem statement, we added a certain features to increase the scope of the app to multiple areas/domains so as to serve the daily needs of the farmers and make their life a little easier.
